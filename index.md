## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# William's First CS193 Homework

**Things I enjoy about CS193 include:**
- The chillness of the class
- The fact that it is basically taught by peers
- So far the homework is easy
- I had a friend from _high school_ that is in the lecture
- I get to make things up for this list. I am so tired rn.


_This is italics_, **this is bold**, _**This is both**_

3. Maybe just try Python instead. `print("Hello World")`

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
